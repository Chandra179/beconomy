# Economy

## Core Economic Principles

* **Market Efficiency:** The property of society getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources.
* **Market Equality:** The property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among the members of society.
* **Opportunity Cost:** The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.
* **Marginal Change:** Small incremental adjustments to a plan of action.
  * **Marginal Benefits:** The additional benefit arising from a unit increase in a particular activity.
  * **Marginal Cost:** The additional cost arising from a unit increase in a particular activity.
* **Incentive:** An incentive is something (such as the prospect of a punishment or reward) that induces a person to act.

## The Invisible Hand and the Role of Government

**Smith’s insight has an important corollary:** When a government prevents prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand’s ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make up an economy.

The **invisible hand** (market forces) can only function effectively when the government provides a stable foundation. We need the government to support the invisible hand in the following ways:

* **Enforcement of Property Rights:** The invisible hand only works if people feel secure owning and controlling resources. Without "rules of the road," a farmer won't plant crops if they expect them to be stolen, and companies won't innovate if their work is pirated.
* **Maintenance of Legal Institutions:** We need government-provided police and courts to ensure that contracts are honored and that producers are paid for what they create.
* **Promoting Efficiency (Fixing Market Failures):** While powerful, the invisible hand is not perfect. The government intervenes to "enlarge the economic pie" when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently on its own.
* **Promoting Equality:** The government steps in to change how the "economic pie" is divided, ensuring that prosperity is distributed more fairly than the market might allow if left completely alone.

#### Key Obstacles to the Invisible Hand

* **Market Failure:** A situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently.
* **Market Power:** The ability of a single economic actor (or small group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices.

## Productivity and Living Standards

* **Basis of Living Standards:** Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input.
* **Policy Implications:** To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.

***

## Inflation and the Short-Run Trade-off

* **Inflation:** An increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.
* **Short-Run Trade-off between Inflation and Unemployment:**
  * Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
  * Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
  * More hiring means lower unemployment.
* **The Business Cycle:** This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle.
* **Policy Intervention:** Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that the government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints, policymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and services.

## Economic Methodology

#### The Scientific Approach

To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention to the natural experiments offered by history.

#### The Role of Assumptions

Economists make assumptions for the same reason:

* Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand.
* **Example:** To study the effects of international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only two countries and that each country produces only two goods. In reality, there are numerous countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of goods. But by considering a world with only two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking on the essence of the problem. Once we understand international trade in this simplified imaginary world, we are in a better position to understand international trade in the more complex world in which we live.

## Economic Models

### Circular Flow Diagram

The Circular-Flow Diagram is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms. It simplifies the complex economy into two main players and two main markets.

**The Two Key Players**

* **Households:** These are the people who own all the factors of production (like their labor) and consume all the goods and services.
* **Firms:** These are the businesses that produce goods and services using inputs like labor, land, and capital.

**The Two Main Markets**

The diagram shows two distinct "loops" where these players meet:

* **Markets for Goods and Services:** Households are the buyers and firms are the sellers. Households spend money to get the things they need.
* **Markets for Factors of Production:** Households are the sellers (providing their labor/work) and firms are the buyers. Firms pay households wages, rent, and profit for their help.

**How the Flows Work**

There are two different types of "currents" flowing in opposite directions:

* **The Flow of Inputs and Outputs (The "Stuff" Loop):**
  1. Households provide labor and land to the Factor Markets.
  2. Factor Markets provide those inputs to Firms.
  3. Firms turn those inputs into goods.
  4. These goods go to the Product Markets, where Households buy them.
* **The Flow of Dollars (The "Money" Loop):**
  1. Households spend money (Expenditure) on goods.
  2. That money becomes Revenue for Firms.
  3. Firms use that revenue to pay for labor and rent (Costs).
  4. That money returns to Households as Income (wages/profit).

### Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

PPF is a fundamental economic graph that shows the maximum possible output combinations of two goods an economy can produce using its available resources and technology. It is a visual representation of scarcity, trade-offs, and efficiency.

## Fields of Study and the Role of the Economist

#### Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics

* **Microeconomics:** The study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets.
  * _Examples:_ The effects of rent control on housing in New York City; the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto industry; the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’ earnings.
* **Macroeconomics:** The study of economy-wide phenomena.
  * _Examples:_ The effects of borrowing by the federal government; the changes over time in the economy’s rate of unemployment; alternative policies to promote growth in national living standards.

#### The Two Roles of Economists

Economists toggle between two distinct modes depending on their objective:

1. **The Scientist (Positive Analysis):** Focuses on how the world is. They use **positive statements**, which are descriptive and can be tested or refuted using data (e.g., "A rise in price causes a decrease in demand").
2. **The Policy Adviser (Normative Analysis):** Focuses on how the world should be. They use **normative statements**, which are prescriptive and involve value judgments, ethics, and political philosophy (e.g., "The government should lower taxes to help the poor").

#### Why Economists Disagree

Conflict in economic advice usually stems from two main sources:

* **Differences in Scientific Judgment:** Economists may have different hunches about the validity of a theory or the size of a specific impact (e.g., disagreeing on whether people save more if taxes are cut).
* **Differences in Values:** Because policy involves "fairness," economists may disagree based on their personal or political beliefs (e.g., debating whether it is "fairer" to tax wealth or income).

## Comparative Advantage

**Comparative Advantage** is the ability to produce a specific good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer. For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between the two opportunity costs.

**Absolute Advantage** looks at who is faster or more productive. The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that good.

## Supply and Demand

#### Fundamentals of a Market

Market: A group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.

* The Buyers: As a group, they determine the demand for the product.
* The Sellers: As a group, they determine the supply of the product.

Competitive Market: A market in which there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price.

#### Demand

* Quantity Demanded: The amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase.
* Market Demand: Essentially the sum of all individual demands for a specific good.
* Law of Demand: (The principle governing the relationship between price and quantity demanded).

#### Supply

* Quantity Supplied: The amount of any good or service that sellers are willing and able to sell.
* Market Supply vs. Individual Supply: Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply is the sum of the supplies of all sellers.
* Law of Supply: (The principle governing the relationship between price and quantity supplied).

#### Equilibrium and Market Imbalance

* Equilibrium: The point where the market "clears." It is the specific price and quantity where the intentions of buyers and sellers perfectly align.
* Shortage / Excess Demand: A situation where demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price.

#### Three-Step Process to Analyze Changes in Equilibrium

To understand how an event affects a market, follow these steps:

1. Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or perhaps both).
2. Decide in which direction the curve shifts.
3. Use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift changes the equilibrium price and quantity.

***

## Elasticity

#### Elastic Demand

Demand is elastic when a small change in price leads to a big change in how much people buy. This usually happens with "wants" rather than "needs." If the price goes up even a little, people quickly switch to a different brand or stop buying it altogether because they are sensitive to the cost.

* Example: If the price of a specific brand of chocolate doubles, you’ll probably buy a different brand or a different snack.

#### Inelastic Demand

Demand is inelastic when a change in price has very little effect on how much people buy. This happens with "needs" or things that have no good substitutes. Consumers are less sensitive to the cost because they feel they must have the product regardless of the price.

* Example: If the price of life-saving insulin or gasoline goes up, people generally continue to buy the same amount because they don't have a choice.

#### Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High?

In the **short run**, both the supply and demand for oil are highly inelastic. This means that because oil reserves and extraction technology cannot be changed quickly, and consumers cannot immediately swap their cars or heating systems, the supply and demand curves are very steep. When OPEC collectively reduced supply in the 1970s, this inelasticity caused the price of oil to skyrocket, significantly increasing the cartel's total revenue because the price increase far outweighed the drop in quantity sold.

However, the market eventually adjusted as l**ong-run** forces took hold. Over several years, high prices incentivized non-OPEC countries to invest in new oil exploration and extraction, while consumers transitioned to fuel-efficient vehicles and conservation efforts. These changes made both supply and demand more elastic, resulting in flatter curves. Consequently, the same **supply restrictions** that once caused massive price spikes became much less effective, leading to a steady decline in prices and the eventual breakdown of the cartel's cooperation in the mid-1980s.

#### Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime?

Drug interdiction focuses on reducing the supply of drugs by catching smugglers and seizing shipments. While this successfully raises the price and reduces the total quantity of drugs consumed, it often backfires regarding public safety. Because drug addicts face a physical dependency, their demand is highly inelastic—they will pay almost any price to get their fix.

When interdiction makes drugs scarcer and more expensive, the price jump is much larger than the drop in usage. As a result, the total revenue paid to drug dealers actually increases. To cover these significantly higher costs, addicts may turn to more frequent or more violent crime, meaning that while drug use goes down, drug-related crime often goes up.

## Price Ceiling

A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold. When the government imposes such a limit, the outcome depends entirely on whether the ceiling is set above or below the natural **market equilibrium**. If the **ceiling is set higher** than the price that naturally balances supply and demand, it is considered non-binding and has no effect on the market. However, when a **ceiling is set below the equilibrium price**, it becomes a binding constraint. Because the price is legally prevented from rising to its natural level, the quantity that consumers want to buy exceeds the quantity that producers are willing to sell, resulting in a persistent shortage of the good.

When these shortages occur, the market can no longer use price to decide who gets the product, so alternative and often inefficient rationing mechanisms emerge. Buyers may be forced to wait in long lines, wasting valuable time, or sellers may begin to ration goods based on personal biases and discrimination. Unlike a **free market** where the price acts as an impersonal and efficient rationing tool, price ceilings often lead to unfair outcomes where those who value the good most or need it most are unable to obtain it.

### OPEC

The historical gasoline shortages of the 1970s provide a clear example of this phenomenon. When OPEC reduced the oil supply, the cost of producing gasoline rose, which should have led to higher prices at the pump. Because U.S. government price ceilings prevented these prices from adjusting, the supply shift created a severe shortage. Motorists were forced to wait for hours for small amounts of fuel, a situation economists attribute more to the price regulations than to the oil shock itself. Once the price controls were repealed, the shortages disappeared as prices were allowed to reach equilibrium once again.

### Rent Control

In the **short run**, the number of apartments in a city is basically a fixed number—you can't build or tear down a skyscraper overnight. Similarly, people don't move out of town the moment a law changes. Because supply and demand are inelastic (not very flexible), a price ceiling on rent doesn't change the number of people living there very much. It successfully lowers the rent for the people already in those apartments without causing a massive immediate problem.

Over several years, however, both landlords and renters become much more elastic (flexible). Their behavior shifts in ways that destroy the housing market:

* Supply Crumbles: If a landlord can't charge enough to make a profit or even cover repairs, they won't build new buildings. They also stop fixing leaky roofs or broken elevators because they have a line of 50 people waiting to move in anyway. Why spend money on a building when you don't have to compete for tenants?
* Demand Explodes: When rent is artificially cheap, more people want their own place. Instead of living with roommates or parents, everyone tries to get their own "rent-controlled" apartment.
* The Massive Shortage: Now you have fewer apartments (because none were built and some became unlivable) and way more people wanting them. This creates a huge gap between the number of available homes and the people who need them.

In the end, while the price on paper is low, the "real" cost is high. You might pay low rent, but you live in a dilapidated (run-down) building with a landlord who ignores your calls. Because the shortage is so bad, people start using under-the-table bribes or "key fees" just to get a landlord to pick them from the waiting list. The policy intended to help the poor often ends up making quality housing impossible to find.

## Price Floor

A price floor is a government-imposed legal minimum on the price at which a good or service can be sold. Unlike a price ceiling, which seeks to keep prices low, a price floor is typically enacted when producers feel the market equilibrium price is too lo&#x77;**.** The impact of a price floor depends on whether it is "binding." If the floor is set **below the equilibrium price**, it is not binding and has no effect on the market. However, if the floor is set **above the equilibrium price**, it prevents the market from reaching a natural balance, leading to a permanent surplus where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.

## Tax Incidence

#### How Taxes on Sellers Affect the Market

When the government mandates that sellers pay a tax (e.g., $0.50 per ice-cream cone), it increases the cost of doing business. This causes the supply curve to shift upward (or to the left) by the exact amount of the tax. Because it is now more expensive to provide the product, the new market equilibrium results in a higher price for buyers and a lower quantity sold. Even though the seller physically hands the money to the government, they "pass on" part of the cost to the buyer through that higher price.

#### How Taxes on Buyers Affect the Market

Conversely, if the government taxes the buyers, the demand curve shifts downward (or to the left) by the amount of the tax. Because the total cost of the good (price + tax) has risen, consumers demand less at every price point. This shift causes the market price to drop. However, while the seller receives a lower price, the buyer’s total cost (the lower price plus the tax they must pay) is still higher than it was originally.

## Markets and Welfare

**surplus** is a measure of the extra value that participants gain from a market transaction. It represents the difference between what someone is willing to do (buy or sell) and what they actually end up doing at the market price.

**Consumer surplus** is the "bargain" a buyer gets. It is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they pay.

* Example: If you are willing to pay $100 for a pair of shoes but find them on sale for $60, your consumer surplus is $40.

**Producer surplus** is the benefit received by sellers. It is the difference between the market price and the minimum price a seller is willing to accept (which is usually their cost of production).

* Example: If a baker is willing to sell a loaf of bread for $2 but the market price is $5, the baker receives a producer surplus of $3.

To evaluate whether a market outcome is desirable, economists use the concept of total surplus as a measure of a society's economic well-being. Mathematically, since the "amount paid by buyers" and "amount received by sellers" are equal, they cancel each other out, leaving a simplified formula:

$$Total\ Surplus = Value\ to\ Buyers - Cost\ to\ Sellers$$

When a market is efficient, the "economic pie" is as large as it can possibly be. This means the goods are being produced by the sellers with the lowest costs and consumed by the buyers who value them most highly. If a good is produced by a high-cost seller instead of a low-cost one, or consumed by someone who values it less than another potential buyer, the market is not reaching its full potential, and total surplus is lost.

* **Optimal Allocation to Buyers**: Free markets ensure that goods go to the consumers who value them most highly based on their willingness to pay.
* **Optimal Allocation for Sellers**: Free markets ensure that demand is met by the producers who can provide the goods at the lowest cost.
* **Optimal Quantity**: The market produces exactly the quantity that maximizes total surplus. At any amount below equilibrium, the value to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers, meaning more should be produced. At any amount above equilibrium, the cost to sellers exceeds the value to buyers, meaning less should be produced.

## **Costs Of Taxation**

**Market taxation** fundamentally alters the behavior of buyers and sellers by creating a price wedge. When a tax is introduced, the price buyers pay increases while the price sellers receive decreases, regardless of which party is legally responsible for paying the tax. This gap reduces the incentive for market participation, leading to a decrease in the quantity of goods traded. Consequently, taxes cause the market size to shrink below its natural equilibrium, resulting in a **deadweight loss**—a loss of total economic welfare that is not offset by the government's tax revenue.

The severity of this deadweight loss is primarily determined by the price elasticity of supply and demand. In markets where buyers and sellers are highly responsive to price changes (high elasticity), a tax will cause a significant drop in trade, leading to a large deadweight loss. Conversely, in markets where participants are less responsive (low elasticity), such as for necessities like milk or medicine, the market quantity changes very little, and the deadweight loss remains relatively small.&#x20;

As the size of a tax increases, its impact on the economy evolves disproportionately. Deadweight loss grows exponentially; for instance, doubling a tax rate actually quadruples the deadweight loss. Tax revenue, however, follows the Laffer Curve: it initially increases with the tax rate but eventually peaks and starts to decline. This happens because a very high tax rate discourages trade so severely that there is little left to tax. Therefore, **higher tax rates** do not always guarantee higher revenue, as the shrinkage of the "economic pie" can eventually outweigh the government's larger slice of it.

## International Trade

The relationship between domestic price to the world prices reveals a nation's comparative advantage. The domestic price serves as a measure of the opportunity cost of producing a good within that country. If the **world price is higher than the domestic price**, the country has a comparative advantage, meaning it can produce the good more cheaply than the rest of the world. Once trade is permitted, this country will become an exporter, as local producers seek the higher profits available in foreign markets.

Conversely, if the **world price is lower than the domestic price**, the rest of the world has a comparative advantage in that industry. In this scenario, the country will become an importer, as local consumers shift their spending to cheaper foreign goods. This comparison allows a nation to determine its strengths and decide how to specialize. International trade is beneficial because it enables countries to focus on the industries where they have the lowest opportunity cost, exchanging their specialized surplus for goods that are produced more efficiently elsewhere.

**The Exporting Country (World Price is Higher)**

If the world price is higher than the domestic price, the country will export.

* The Winners: Domestic producers. They can now sell their goods at the higher world price, significantly increasing their producer surplus.
* The Losers: Domestic consumers. They now have to pay the higher world price for goods that used to be cheaper at home.
* Net Result: Even though consumers lose, the gains for producers are much larger. The total surplus of the country increases, represented by the "gains from trade" triangle.

**The Importing Country (World Price is Lower)**

If the world price is lower than the domestic price, the country will import.

* The Winners: Domestic consumers. They get to enjoy much lower prices by buying from foreign sellers, increasing their consumer surplus.
* The Losers: Domestic producers. They are forced to lower their prices to compete with cheap imports, causing their producer surplus to shrink.
* Net Result: The gains for consumers outweigh the losses for producers. Again, the country’s total surplus increases.

A **tariff** is a tax on imported goods that only impacts a market if the country is an importer. Its primary function is to raise the domestic price of a good above the world price, bringing the market closer to the "no-trade" equilibrium.

free trade destroys domestic employment. While it is true that importing cheaper textiles may cause job losses in the domestic textile sector, economists argue that resources and labor eventually shift toward industries where the country holds a **comparative advantage**

To achieve free trade, nations generally choose between two paths: A **unilateral approach** occurs when a country removes its own trade barriers independently, as seen in the historical examples of Great Britain or more recently in Chile and South Korea. In contrast, the **multilateral approach** involves coordinated negotiations where multiple countries agree to reduce trade restrictions simultaneously, effectively "trading" market access with one another.

**Major Agreements and Institutions**

The multilateral approach is responsible for the modern landscape of global commerce. Key examples include:

* NAFTA: A regional agreement that lowered barriers between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
* GATT: Established after World War II to prevent a return to the high-tariff era of the Great Depression; it successfully lowered average global tariffs from 40% to roughly 5%.
* The World Trade Organization (WTO): Founded in 1995 to enforce GATT rules, the WTO acts as a global referee, mediating trade disputes and providing a permanent forum for ongoing negotiations among its 162+ member nations.

## Externalities

**Externality** is a side effect of an economic activity that affects someone who isn't directly involved in it.

**Negative Externalities**: Adverse impacts on bystanders (e.g., pollution, loud dogs). Because the parties involved don't pay for these "costs," the market produces too much of the activity.

**Positive Externalities**: Beneficial impacts on bystanders (e.g., historic preservation, tech research). Because the parties involved don't receive the full "reward," the market produces too little of the activity.

**Market Failure**: Since buyers and sellers ignore these external effects, the market equilibrium fails to maximize total societal well-being.

To address the inefficiencies caused by externalities, governments generally employ two primary strategies. **Command-and-control policies** involve direct regulation, such as prohibiting harmful behaviors or mandating specific emission limits and technologies. While effective for banning dangerous activities, these regulations can be rigid and difficult to implement efficiently since they require the government to possess detailed industrial knowledge.

Think of **market-based policies** as the government changing the price tags on certain behaviors rather than just making them illegal. Instead of telling a company "You are not allowed to do this," the government says, "You can do this, but it’s going to cost you."

While externalities often lead to market inefficiencies, they can be resolved privately through **moral codes, charities, or contracts between interested parties**. The Coase theorem suggests that if private parties can bargain without cost, they will reach an efficient outcome regardless of how legal rights are initially distributed, as parties will naturally negotiate to "internalize" the costs or benefits. However, this often fails in the real world due to transaction costs, such as legal fees or the difficulty of coordinating large groups, which prevents a mutually beneficial agreement from being reached.

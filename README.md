opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item

incentive is something (such as the prospect of a punishment or reward) that\
induces a person to act

Smith’s insight has an important corollary: When a government prevents\
prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible\
hand’s ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make\
up an economy.

**invisible hand** (market forces) can only function effectively when the government provides a stable foundation. We need the government to support the invisible hand in the following ways:

* Enforcement of Property Rights: The invisible hand only works if people feel secure owning and controlling resources. Without "rules of the road," a farmer won't plant crops if they expect them to be stolen, and companies won't innovate if their work is pirated.
* Maintenance of Legal Institutions: We need government-provided police and courts to ensure that contracts are honored and that producers are paid for what they create.
* Promoting Efficiency (Fixing Market Failures): While powerful, the invisible hand is not perfect. The government intervenes to "enlarge the economic pie" when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently on its own.
* Promoting Equality: The government steps in to change how the "economic pie" is divided, ensuring that prosperity is distributed more fairly than the market might allow if left completely alone.

Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input

To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity\
by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce\
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.

inflation, an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy

Short-Run Trade-off between Inflation and Unemployment

* Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level\
  of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
* Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the\
  meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a\
  larger quantity of goods and services.
* More hiring means lower unemployment.

This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle

Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that the\
government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints, policymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and services.

To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention\
to the natural experiments offered by history.

Economists make assumptions for the same reason

* Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand. To study the effects of
* international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only\
  two countries and that each country produces only two goods. In reality, there\
  are numerous countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of\
  goods. But by considering a world with only two countries and two goods, we\
  can focus our thinking on the essence of the problem. Once we understand international trade in this simplified imaginary world, we are in a better position to\
  understand international trade in the more complex world in which we live.

### Circular Flow Diagram

The Circular-Flow Diagram is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms. It simplifies the complex economy into two main players and two main markets.

#### 1. The Two Key Players

* Households: These are the people who own all the factors of production (like their labor) and consume all the goods and services.
* Firms: These are the businesses that produce goods and services using inputs like labor, land, and capital.

***

#### 2. The Two Main Markets

The diagram shows two distinct "loops" where these players meet:

* Markets for Goods and Services: Households are the buyers and firms are the sellers. Households spend money to get the things they need.
* Markets for Factors of Production: Households are the sellers (providing their labor/work) and firms are the buyers. Firms pay households wages, rent, and profit for their help.

#### 3. How the Flows Work

There are two different types of "currents" flowing in opposite directions:

**The Flow of Inputs and Outputs (The "Stuff" Loop)**

1. Households provide labor and land to the Factor Markets.
2. Factor Markets provide those inputs to Firms.
3. Firms turn those inputs into goods.
4. These goods go to the Product Markets, where Households buy them.

**The Flow of Dollars (The "Money" Loop)**

1. Households spend money (Expenditure) on goods.
2. That money becomes Revenue for Firms.
3. Firms use that revenue to pay for labor and rent (Costs).
4. That money returns to Households as Income (wages/profit).

### Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

PPF is a fundamental economic graph that shows the maximum possible output combinations of two goods an economy can produce using its available resources and technology. It is a visual representation of scarcity, trade-offs, and efficiency.



Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions\
and how they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of\
economy-wide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent\
control on housing in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the\
U.S. auto industry, or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’\
earnings.&#x20;

A macroeconomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal\
government, the changes over time in the economy’s rate of unemployment, or\
alternative policies to promote growth in national living standards

#### 1. The Two Roles of Economists

Economists toggle between two distinct modes depending on their objective:

* The Scientist (Positive Analysis): Focuses on how the world is. They use positive statements, which are descriptive and can be tested or refuted using data (e.g., "A rise in price causes a decrease in demand").
* The Policy Adviser (Normative Analysis): Focuses on how the world should be. They use normative statements, which are prescriptive and involve value judgments, ethics, and political philosophy (e.g., "The government should lower taxes to help the poor").

***

#### 2. Why Economists Disagree

Conflict in economic advice usually stems from two main sources:

* Differences in Scientific Judgment: Economists may have different hunches about the validity of a theory or the size of a specific impact (e.g., disagreeing on whether people save more if taxes are cut).
* Differences in Values: Because policy involves "fairness," economists may disagree based on their personal or political beliefs (e.g., debating whether it is "fairer" to tax wealth or income).

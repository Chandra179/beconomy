# GDP

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. It measures economic activity (output), not just the money sitting in banks (wealth).

#### Nominal vs. Real GDP (The Inflation Filter)

Nominal GDP: Measured using current prices. It can rise just because things got expensive (inflation), even if production stayed the same.

Real GDP: Measured using constant prices (fixed to a "Base Year"). It removes "price noise" to show if the country is physically producing more stuff.

#### Production vs. Sales

GDP tracks creation, not just transactions.

* Unsold Goods: If a car is built in 2024 but sits in a lot, it is counted in 2024 GDP as "Inventory Investment."&#x20;
* The labor and resources were used _now_, so the economic value belongs to _now_.
* Year 2 (The Sale): When that car finally sells in 2025, it is added to "Consumption" but subtracted from Inventory. Net Change: $$0$$. This prevents double-counting and keeps the value in the year it was actually made.
